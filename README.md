# Modern R Programming Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Modern R Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-r-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785889776), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
R is a powerful tool for statistics, graphics, and statistical programming. It is used by tens of thousands of people daily to perform serious statistical analyses. It is a free, open source system whose implementation is the collective accomplishment of many intelligent, hard-working people. There are more than 2,000 available add-ons, and R is a serious rival to all commercial statistical packages. The objective of this book is to show how to work with different programming aspects of R. The emerging R developers and data science could have very good programming knowledge but might have limited understanding about R syntax and semantics. Our book will be a platform develop practical solution out of real world problem in scalable fashion and with very good understanding. You will work with various versions of R libraries that are essential for scalable data science solutions. You will learn to work with Input / Output issues when working with relatively larger dataset. At the end of this book readers will also learn how to work with databases from within R and also what and how meta programming helps in developing applications.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 1 does not contain any code.

The code will look like the following:
```
M1 <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol= 3, byrow=TRUE)
    D1 <- data.frame(x1= c(1,3,2,4,5), x2= c("Cricket",    "Football",  "Basketball", "Rugby", "Baseball" ))
```

This book requires the following to be set up:

Base R
RStudio IDE
Microsoft R Client
R tools for Visual Studio
PostgreSQL database server
